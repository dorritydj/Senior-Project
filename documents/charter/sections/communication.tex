Daniel Dorrity, as project manager, will send emails to all stakeholders, excluding students, when wireframes are complete, requesting approval and or changes. If those emails are not responded to within 3 days, the chance to make any major change suggestion will not be heard. Daniel will send a condensed 4UP chart ever two weeks. This chart will explain what the development team has completed and is currently working on. It will also detail and issues or risks, and any needs as well. All stakeholders will be expected to read these emails, and respond, addressing any concerns they may have.
