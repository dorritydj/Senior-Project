When a student is satisfied with his/hers received information, and then further impressed by our extra features, ease of use, and lightning-fast operation, then we are also content with the outcome. The critical point we want to achieve is that there will be no issues in the areas of: visual guidance, execution speed, and data coherence and display. The goal we strive for is to make the user's first interaction feel like he/she is used to it and to make it a natural handling of an advanced yet user-friendly application. This presents us with these stated success criteria:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item All students must be able to easily use the product. This includes interaction and processing of presented information
	\item IST staff members must be able to learn and use the product with great ease. This includes interaction, processing, and understanding of verification of the presented and entered information
	\item The IST department is satisfied with the look, use and implementation of the final product. This includes design, user interaction and presentation of the data
\end{enumerate}
