The IST department is an essential part in the grand RIT information scheme. What if we make a part of their job easier, while at the same time we incluse the students as our prime users? The automation of this system will make the information channels much smoother and more responsive. New students will acquire new information about the campus and will ease their integration into a new life as a student, while more seasoned students will use the application to see any new updates in the department's information collection. This presents us with a few main goals of the application:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A touch screen display will be attached to the wall near the atrium stairwell on the second floor
	\item The time and effort it takes for IST staff members to update, add, or remove professor information will be greatly reduced
	\item The time it takes for a student to find information about a professor, including a map to that professor's room, will be greatly reduced
	\item The time it takes for a student to locate, and get directions to, a specific lab or classroom will be greatly reduced
\end{enumerate}
