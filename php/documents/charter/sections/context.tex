This project has the potential to carry into other departments and even other colleges at RIT. This project could strengthen relationships between the IST department and other colleges, as other colleges may see it, like the idea, and then use the currently implemented system to build their own version.

This will consolidate a way of providing a new and interesting educational experience for students of all ages.
