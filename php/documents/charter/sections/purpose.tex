The purpose of this project is to bring the faculty directory for the IST department up to date with current and modern technology. The IST department finds it difficult to update the faculty board every time a new professor is added or removed from the department. Because of this, they wish to implement a technological solution that would allow this information to be updated with greater ease.\\

We believe that implementing such a practical solution would benefit all the students, staff and faculty members in an effort to digitize school information, providing a new step for the campus to evolve and enhance student life.\\

Not only would this benefit the current member of RIT, but it would also show visitors and other schools our willingness and dedication to a student's campus life. Our plans are not constrained by the original idea. We want to further enrich this project by adding what we deem vital features to the main application.
